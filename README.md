# Hi there, I'm Adryson! üëã

I'm Adryson Freitas, a passionate front-end developer and designer (web, graphic and UI/UX) from Brazil. I graduated in Computer Science in 2023 with a final paper themed around front-end development.

I'm a really creative person and I love to do create stuff, even more when it is something visual. I also like to learn new things, I'm always learning.

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

- [RMCritic](https://github.com/AdrysonFreitas/rmcritic): A Django project made for fun for a group of friends as private music albums rating system based on their reviews. It gives some statistics about those ratings.
- [Infpac](https://github.com/AdrysonFreitas/infpac-site): A Django project made with the RMCritic website as a template and customized to be used by a healthcare program to release its open publications.
- [MW Store](https://github.com/mwmodaesportiva/mwmodaesportiva_ecommerce): A webstore made in NextJS as a collaborative project with a friend. It's just a simple website that will display the products on storage and their price, with filters and a admin pannel to update the base. _Still in progress_.
- [Reorganize o Brasil](https://github.com/AdrysonFreitas/reorganize-o-brasil): A fun website in which you can play with Brazil's subdivisions, create new states based on municipalities and you will have many stats available to that state, so you can compare it with others.
